# 10 Rules of Good studying # 

1. **User recall:** After reading a page, look away and try to remember the main ideas. Retrieving ideas from oneself is a key indicator oflearning. Furthermore try to recall in different places. 

 It is very important to me that we must recall after every page. I really don't do that. Must practice it.


2. **Test yourself:** On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend.

I don't know what to do with flash cards.  Should check why and which methods.


3. **Chunk your problems:** "Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it can all come to mind in a flash. After you solve a problem, rehearse it. Make sure you can solve it cold—every step. Pretend it’s a song and learn to play it over and over again in your mind, so the information combines into one smooth chunk you can pull up whenever you want."

The song part is very interesting. I must assimilate that I should learn one little part, of the problem, so I can later create a larger part by uniting the little parts.
I think I'm getting closer to understanding the chunking concept. Divide into parts the problem. Learn them well and unite them, when it's logically possible)
	
It is necessary to solve a problem step by step in order to really understand.

4. **Space your repetition:** Regarless of subject, program it's learning between different days. Consider that the brain is a muscle. It can only sustain a certain ammount of learning and should be trained responsibly 

I think that for this is necessary to organize oneself. And be flexible enough to add or remove hours.
I think that because of this, I can track my progress and see how much I can really work


5. **Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice:** When solving a problem, try different approaches. After a while, using the same approach will be more of a mimic/automated actions.

Do different kinds of types problems. So you can understand how and when to use an approach. 


7. **Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies.** When struggling with a concept, tell to yourself: "how can I explain this to a 5 year old or to an elder?" Using analogies help a lot. Also saying the explaination or writing it.
