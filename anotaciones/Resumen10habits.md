# 10 Rules of Good studying # 

1. **User recall:** After reading a page, look away and try to remember the main ideas. Retrieving ideas from oneself is a key indicator oflearning. Furthermore try to recall in different places. 

 It is very important to me that we must recall after every page. I really don't do that. Must practice it.


2. **Test yourself:** On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend.

I don't know what to do with flash cards.  Should check why and which methods.


3. **Chunk your problems:** "Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it can all come to mind in a flash. After you solve a problem, rehearse it. Make sure you can solve it cold—every step. Pretend it’s a song and learn to play it over and over again in your mind, so the information combines into one smooth chunk you can pull up whenever you want."

The song part is very interesting. I must assimilate that I should learn one little part, of the problem, so I can later create a larger part by uniting the little parts.
I think I'm getting closer to understanding the chunking concept. Divide into parts the problem. Learn them well and unite them, when it's logically possible)
	
4. **Space your repetition:** Regarless of subject, program it's learning between different days. Consider that the brain is a muscle. It can only sustain a certain ammount of learning and should be trained responsibly
